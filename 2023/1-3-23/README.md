# Tidy Tuesday 1 : Loading in Data with R and Python
## 1-3-23: Bring Your Own Data 

This is the first Tidy Tuesday of the year. As someone who mostly does their data analysis in Python, I want to use the weekly Tidy Tuesday challenges to challenge myself to explore R deeper. I will be doing the "challenge" every week in both R and Python, choosing a different type of plot to explore in the two languages. 

The dataset for the first week of the year is : Bring Your Own. With that, I will be using the dataset from Tidy Tuesday that occurred on my birthday last year. I will be loading in the Eurovision Voting set from Tidy Tuesday. 

## This Week: Loading in Data with Python and R 

This week I will be starting off light challenging myself to refresh on how to load in csv data using both R and Python. 

### Python

To load in data with Python, I chose to use a popular library within data science : pandas. Pandas is the most popular library for data analysis because of it's many powerful features. Users are able to not only load in but manipulate and analyze data by taking slices, filtering by conditions, quickly indexing and much more. 

Datasets in pandas are called DataFrames. These easily store data in a SQL table like format. 

### R 

To load in data with R, I chose to use the popular TidyVerse library. Tidyverse contains some of the most popular packages for loading in, manipulating, and analyzing data within R. 

Datasets in R are called Tibbles. They are "opinionated" versions of the R data.frame type.
